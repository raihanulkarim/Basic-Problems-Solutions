# CSharpPractice
Practice on some basic problems.
# Problem 1: 
Write a program that converts 1 lower case letter ("a" - "z") to its corresponding upper case letter ("A" - "Z"). For example if the user enters "c" then the program will show "C" on the screen.
# Problem 2
Write a program that takes three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) from the user and the program will check wheteher or not all the three points fall on one straight line.
# Problem 3
Write a program that takes coordinates (x, y) of a center of a circle and its radius from the user, the program will determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle.
# Problem 4
Write a program that takes a character from the user and determines whether the character entered is a capital letter, a small case letter, a digit or a special symbol. The following table shows the range of ASCII values for various characters.
# Problem 5
Write a program using a switch statement that takes one value from the user and asks about the type of conversion and then performs a conversion depending on the type of conversion. If user enters:
I -> convert from inches to centimeters.
G -> convert from gallons to liters.
M -> convert from mile to kilometer.
P -> convert from pound to kilogram.
If the user enters any other character then show a proper message.
# Problem 6
Write a program using conditional operators to determine whether a year entered through the keyboard is a leap year or not.
# Problem 7
Write a program that prints an identity matrix using a for loop, in other words takes a value n from the user and shows the identity table of size n * n.
# Problem 8
Write a program using a for loop that prints the following series.
1 2 4 8 16 21 64 128 â€¦nth iteration.
# Problem 9
Write a program using a for loop that prints the following output (you need to find a pattern to print letters in this order):
A B D H P
# Problem 10
Write a program using a loop that prints the following output.
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5 6 6 6 6 6 6 . . . nth iteration.

# Problem 11
An array is given , need to generate another array by rearranging values sequentially,
i.e.
b[0] = a[0]
b[1] = a[UpperBound]
b[2] = a[1]
and so on.
Then return true or false based on whether the newly created array is sorted or not.

# Problem 12
You are given an array of string arr. Your task is to construct a string from the words in arr, starting with 0th character from each word(in the order they appear in 'arr), followed by the 1st character, then the 2nd character, etc. If one of the words doesn't have an ith character,skip that word. Return the resulting string.
